Using the MNIST dataset and Scikit-learn, created an image recognition machine learning model that gets a 97% f1 score.

Many functions are no longer used for the final model. These were functions that I used to refine the model, and also data augmentation and feature engineering ideas that I tryed that did not work to the benifit of the model they were created for. I left them in becasue this was a learning process, and those 'failures' were what contributed to my learning and were stepping stones to achive as high a score as I did.
